"""Ark's changes to OK-WW, installed without editing a single upstream file.

ok-script has a documented extension point: with `custom_tasks: True` (which
ok-wuthering-waves sets in its own config.py) the task manager creates an
`ok_tasks/` folder in the working directory and **executes every .py in it** at
startup, before any task runs. It only executes a file that defines at least one
top-level class, so `_Marker` below is load-bearing even though it does nothing.

Running there lets this file rebind methods on upstream's own classes. Python
looks a method up on the class at call time, so a rebind reaches instances that
were already constructed - including the built-in FarmEchoTask that DailyTask
finds through `get_task_by_class`. Subclassing cannot do that: that lookup
returns the first matching instance and the built-ins are registered first.

**Every rebind is checked before it happens.** A method that upstream renamed or
refactored away would otherwise be replaced under a name nobody calls, and the
behaviour would go missing without a word - the exact failure the text patches
kept producing. What was checked, applied and skipped is written to
`ark-okww-overlay.json`, which the relay reads at boot and pushes.
